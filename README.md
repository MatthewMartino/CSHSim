# CSH Simulator - A Virtual Reality Experience

Presented by [Procrastination Studios](http://www.csh.rit.edu/~tino) and [CSH](csh.rit.edu)

## What is CSH Simulator?

CSH Simulator was made with the hope of recreating the entire "Computer Science House" floor of dorms, to scale, located at Rochester Institute of Technology.

The project is currently being developed in UE4 with hopes of being compatible with Desktop (Oculus, Vive) and Mobile VR Headsets (Go, Gear).
